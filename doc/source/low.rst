V-71987 - The operating system must remove all software components after updated versions have been installed. - RHEL-07-020200
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous versions of software components that are not removed from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited by adversaries. Some information technology products may remove older versions of software automatically from the information system.

Fix
~~~

Configure the operating system to remove all software components after updated versions have been installed.

Set the "clean_requirements_on_remove" option to "1" in the "/etc/yum.conf" file:

clean_requirements_on_remove=1

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system removes all software components after updated versions have been installed.

Check if yum is configured to remove unneeded packages with the following command:

# grep -i clean_requirements_on_remove /etc/yum.conf
clean_requirements_on_remove=1

If "clean_requirements_on_remove" is not set to "1", "True", or "yes", or is not set in "/etc/yum.conf", this is a finding.

V-72003 - All Group Identifiers (GIDs) referenced in the /etc/passwd file must be defined in the /etc/group file. - RHEL-07-020300
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user is assigned the GID of a group not existing on the system, and a group with the GID is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to any files associated with the group.

Fix
~~~

Configure the system to define all GIDs found in the "/etc/passwd" file by modifying the "/etc/group" file to add any non-existent group referenced in the "/etc/passwd" file, or change the GIDs referenced in the "/etc/passwd" file to a group that exists in "/etc/group".

Check
~~~~~

Verify all GIDs referenced in the "/etc/passwd" file are defined in the "/etc/group" file.

Check that all referenced GIDs exist with the following command:

# pwck -r

If GIDs referenced in "/etc/passwd" file are returned as not defined in "/etc/group" file, this is a finding.

V-72059 - A separate file system must be used for user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent). - RHEL-07-021310
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.

Fix
~~~

Migrate the "/home" directory onto a separate file system/partition.

Check
~~~~~

Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:

#cut -d: -f 1,3,6,7 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}" | tr ":" "\t"

adamsj /home/adamsj /bin/bash
jacksonm /home/jacksonm /bin/bash
smithj /home/smithj /bin/bash

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.

# grep /home /etc/fstab
UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2

If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a finding.

V-72069 - The file integrity tool must be configured to verify Access Control Lists (ACLs). - RHEL-07-021600
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

ACLs can provide permissions beyond those permitted through the file mode and must be verified by file integrity tools.

Fix
~~~

Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory ACLs. 

If AIDE is installed, ensure the "acl" rule is present on all file and directory selection lists.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify ACLs.

Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the system with the following command:

# yum list installed aide

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system. 

If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this is a finding.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory. 

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

# find / -name aide.conf

Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "acl" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.

An example rule that includes the "acl" rule is below:

All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
/bin All            # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
/sbin All          # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 

If the "acl" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or ACLs are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.

V-72071 - The file integrity tool must be configured to verify extended attributes. - RHEL-07-021610
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata with security implications.

Fix
~~~

Configure the file integrity tool to check file and directory extended attributes. 

If AIDE is installed, ensure the "xattrs" rule is present on all file and directory selection lists.

Check
~~~~~

Verify the file integrity tool is configured to verify extended attributes.

Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed on the system with the following command:

# yum list installed aide

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system.

If there is no application installed to perform file integrity checks, this is a finding.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the "aide.conf" file is under the "/etc" directory.  

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

# find / -name aide.conf

Check the "aide.conf" file to determine if the "xattrs" rule has been added to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists.

An example rule that includes the "xattrs" rule follows:

All= p+i+n+u+g+s+m+S+sha512+acl+xattrs+selinux
/bin All            # apply the custom rule to the files in bin 
/sbin All          # apply the same custom rule to the files in sbin 

If the "xattrs" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the "/etc/aide.conf" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by another file integrity tool, this is a finding.

V-72217 - The operating system must limit the number of concurrent sessions to 10 for all accounts and/or account types. - RHEL-07-040000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.

This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined based on mission needs and the operational environment for each system.

Fix
~~~

Configure the operating system to limit the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types.

Add the following line to the top of the /etc/security/limits.conf:

* hard maxlogins 10

Check
~~~~~

Verify the operating system limits the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types by issuing the following command:

# grep "maxlogins" /etc/security/limits.conf
* hard maxlogins 10

This can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for multiple domains.

If the "maxlogins" item is missing or the value is not set to "10" or less for all domains that have the "maxlogins" item assigned, this is a finding.

V-72275 - The system must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon logon. - RHEL-07-040530
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Providing users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.

Fix
~~~

Configure the operating system to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred by setting the required configuration options in "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac". 

Add the following line to the top of "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac":

session     required      pam_lastlog.so showfailed

Check
~~~~~

Verify users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that "pam_lastlog" is used and not silent with the following command:

# grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac
session required pam_lastlog.so showfailed

If the "silent" option is present with "pam_lastlog" check the sshd configuration file.

# grep -i printlastlog /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PrintLastLog yes

If "pam_lastlog" is missing from "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac" file, or the silent option is present and PrintLastLog is missing from or set to "no" in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file this is a finding.

V-72281 - For systems using DNS resolution, at least two name servers must be configured. - RHEL-07-040600
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severity
~~~~~~~~

Low

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

Fix
~~~

Configure the operating system to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

Edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers. If local host resolution is being performed, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. An empty "/etc/resolv.conf" file can be created as follows:

# echo -n > /etc/resolv.conf

And then make the file immutable with the following command:

# chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

If the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be mutable, the required configuration must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and the file must be verified by the system file integrity tool.

Check
~~~~~

Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command:

# grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts:   files dns

If the DNS entry is missing from the hostâ€™s line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty.

Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command:

# ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root        0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf

If local host authentication is being used and the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is not empty, this is a finding.

If the DNS entry is found on the hostâ€™s line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:

# grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 192.168.1.3

If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.
